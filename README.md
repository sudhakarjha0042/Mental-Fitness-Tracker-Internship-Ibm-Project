## Introduction

Mental health is a critical aspect of overall well-being. The Mental Fitness Tracker aims to help users gain a better understanding of mental health trends and potential risk factors that contribute to mental health disorders. The project uses machine learning techniques, specifically a Random Forest Regressor, to predict the impact of mental disorders on DALYs. It provides data visualizations to convey insights and allow users to explore the relationships between mental disorders and DALYs.

## Features

- Data Visualization: Visualize the prevalence of various mental disorders and their correlation with DALYs using heatmaps, pair plots, and more.
- Feature Importance: Discover which mental disorders have the most significant impact on overall mental fitness using feature importance visualization.
- User Input: Users can input data for specific mental disorders to receive predictions for DALYs based on the trained model.
- Data Preprocessing: Missing values are filled with the mean, and the data is standardized for better model performance.
- Interactive Dashboard (Future Enhancement): The application is designed to be extended into an interactive dashboard with real-time predictions and user alerts.
